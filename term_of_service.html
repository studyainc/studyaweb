</p>

<p><strong>SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>
All information provided on this website is for informational purposes only. Information displayed through the Services related to any virtual vehicle you may configure, such as factory invoice, market average, MSRP, price before TTL, Studya Estimate, or Estimated Savings, either reflects or is based on available data relevant to your virtual vehicle and does not reflect a dealer's price for an actual vehicle consistent with your preferences. Neither the accuracy of information provided on this website, nor the availability, quality, or safety of vehicles, is guaranteed or controlled by Studya, and Studya assumes no responsibility for the foregoing. You agree that any reliance on the information on this website is at your own risk. Any discrepancies or mistakes made regarding vehicle availability, condition, pricing, and the like are not the responsibility of Studya. You are encouraged to thoroughly review any documents you are asked to sign at the time of purchase or lease of a vehicle or of other products or services. We do invite you to bring to our attention any material on our website that you believe to be inaccurate; please forward a copy of such material and your reasons for your belief to support[at]studya[dot]us.
</p>
<p>
By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that dealers may not have in inventory a new vehicle that exactly matches any virtual vehicle you may configure on the website, and certain models or configurations may not be available. Your dealer will confirm vehicle availability, including available options and colors, from actual inventory. Each dealer sets and controls its own pricing. You may negotiate the purchase price directly with the dealer,. The savings information communicated directly to you by a selling dealer for a vehicle consistent with the preferences expressed in any virtual vehicle you may configure may change if the actual in-stock vehicle that you choose to buy differs from the configuration of your virtual vehicle..
</p>
<p>
For the avoidance of doubt, Studya is solely a research and communications platform. Studya is not a vehicle seller, dealer, broker or agent for vehicle sellers or dealers. 
</p>
<p>
We may provide links to other websites. You acknowledge and agree that, because we have no control over such sites, we are not responsible for them or the resources and information they contain. In particular, we are not responsible for the availability of services related to another website that has a link on studya.us; we do not necessarily endorse such sites, and we are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites.
</p>
<p>
Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such advertiser. You acknowledge and agree that Studya will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such advertisers on the Service.
</p>

You agree that Studya shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services (or any part thereof).
</p>

<p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>
You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Studya and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees, and agents (each a “Studya Entity” and collectively “Studya Entities”) from all claims, whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Claims”), that arise out of or in connection with a breach of these Terms of Service, use of the Services, including any content you submit, post, transmit, modify or otherwise make available through the Services, and/or any violation of law and/or the rights of any third party. You are solely responsible for defending any Claim against a Studya Entity, subject to such Studya Entity’s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, at its own expense, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from all Claims against a Studya Entity, provided that you will not agree to any settlement that imposes any obligation or liability on a Studya Entity without its prior express written consent.
</p>

IN ADDITION, STUDYA DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST DEFECTS IN ANY VEHICLE, AND DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, PROMISES, OR STATEMENTS AS TO THE CONDITION, FITNESS, OR MERCHANTABILITY OF ANY VEHICLE OR SERVICE.

YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CLAIM (WHETHER FOR INJURY, ILLNESS, DAMAGE, LIABILITY AND/OR COST) AGAINST THE STUDYA ENTITIES ARISING OUT OF OUR COLLECTION, USE, RETENTION AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
</p>
<p>
YOU HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ALL LAWS THAT MAY LIMIT THE FORGOING RELEASES/WAIVERS. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO WAIVE THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH PROVIDES:
</p>
<p>
“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IS KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
</p>

<p><strong>EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS</strong></p>

<p>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Studya may provide you with notices by email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message, postings on the Services/website, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed.

<p><strong>CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></p>

<p>
The Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Studya are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict/choice of law provisions, and that any and all claims, causes of action, or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, or the relationship between you and Studya, shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. You and Studya waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and venue in such courts. ANY CLAIM AGAINST ANY OF THE STUDYA ENTITIES SHALL BE ADJUDICATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND SHALL NOT BE CONSOLIDATED IN ANY PROCEEDING WITH ANY CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY OF ANY OTHER PARTY. AS SUCH, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATION AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST ANY OF THE STUDYA ENTITIES. You may not be a representative of other potential claimants or a class of potential claimants in any dispute, nor may two or more individuals' disputes be consolidated or otherwise determined in one proceeding. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services, including this website, or the Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>
These Terms of Service may be amended from time to time without notice in Studya’s sole discretion. Any changes to the Terms of Service will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Terms of Service on this website. The Terms of Service, including any agreements and terms incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and Studya and govern your use of the Services, including this website, and supersede any prior version of these Terms of Service between you and Studya with respect to the Services. The failure of Studya to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms of Service, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms of Service. The headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the word “including” is a term of enlargement meaning “including without limitation” and does not denote exclusivity, and the words “will,” “shall,” and “must” are deemed to be equivalent and denote a mandatory obligation or prohibition, as applicable. All definitions apply both to their singular and plural forms, as the context may require. Questions regarding these Terms of Service should be sent to: legal[at]studya[dot]us.
